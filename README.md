# clean-code-workshop
###Goals:
You are requested to read code of [bank.py](services/bank.py), and try and figure out what the following methods does:
* move
* plan_estimation
* how_much
* account_details

Was it easy to understand what does methods does? if NOT, try to think why? what made it hard for you to understand the code?

###How to read the code?
you can just read the code in github, there are only 4 files, and most of the code is in the [bank.py](services/bank.py) file.

If you wish, you're more than welcome to [git clone](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) this repository locally, and read the code in pycharm (or any other editor you wish).

`git clone git@github.com:borischerkasky/clean-code-workshop.git <directory of your choice>`

###Workshop:
In the upcoming workshop we are going to [refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) this code, and hopefully, make it more understandable.
